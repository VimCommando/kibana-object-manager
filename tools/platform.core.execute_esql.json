The output of the `platform.core.generate_esql` tool (if the tool is available).\n2.  A verbatim query provided directly by the user.\n\nUnder no circumstances should you invent, guess, or modify a query yourself for this tool.\nIf you need a query, use the `platform.core.generate_esql` tool first.",
